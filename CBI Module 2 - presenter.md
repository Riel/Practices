## History of CB

- I would like to share a little about the history of CB.
- The process was developed by the author of the BS book `Road less traveled`: M Scott Peck.
- He traveled in america / around the word : saw a great lack of Community everywhere.
- He saw great `loneliness and isolation`.
- He wanted to do something about this --> created a WS
  - to provide an experience of true community and
  - teach people how to build Community.
- Many people from around the world came to his workshops.
- Participants --> originally psychologists, social workers and faith based people.
- Peck's health fainted and his work fell into the background for a while.
- After a while Bob Roberts used `CBW` with ex-offenders and got dramatic results.
- A core group of supporters developed
  - there was a 2 year pilot project to train `CBW` facilitators
- It was funded by the state.
- The funding has been renewed 4 times now. `CBI` was contracted to provide facilitator training.

> add context about this specific workshop, why is it being held

## Brief Introductions

Let us have a circle of a brief introduction.
Please let us know the followings about yourself:

- What is your name?
- Where were you born?
- Where do you live now?

> I go first, role model answering

## Purpose, Goal

 > read purpose

- The word Community has many different meanings.
- Give us your thoughts on what the world `Community` mean for you!
- The word is generally used 
  - to name groups based on geographic location: `Budapest community` 
  - to name people grouped based on some attributes like religion: `Christian community`
  - it is used even to describe housing projects.
- Peck used this word in a different and very specific way:

``` text
It is an experience a group of people can have if they learn certain guidelines for communication.
```

- We describe community as an `Experience of unusual safety and extraordinary respect`
- It is arrived at by putting certain rules of communication into practice

- The way we live in the modern society works against `Community`.
- This workshop is about learning your obstacles to being real, authentic with others.
- Community is an experience of
  - authentic connection
  - caring
  - unusual safety
  - and extraordinary respect.
- Some groups reach the stage and experience of `Community`, some not.
- Our goal for this workshop is to reach it.
- Even if we do not, the process is still very valuable.

## About the process

- There are some things we can tell about CB and there are some we cannot.
- The reason we cannot tell some
  - not that we keep something from you but because each group is so unique

> read each item, use short explanation

## Can tell you

### Facilitators are guides only

- Rather than providing specific instructions we
  - let you work on your own and
  - point out if you are going in the wrong direction.
- No lectures, no PP presentations.
- We ask you not to take notes.
- You might see us taking notes. This is to:
  - help us remember things about the group
  - help us facilitate
  - help during the debrief when we discuss this groups unique experience of building `Community`.
- We will not be present during the breaks:
  - we do our work that time as well.

### There are usually for stages

- As we experience the stages we might describe them more along the way
  - offer observations and suggestions.
- We will discuss them during the debrief using content from this workshop to illustrate them.
- Our goal is to reach the 4th stage of true community.

### Silence will be used now and then

- Silence helps us learn to listen more deeply to others and ourselves
- Silence will be used intentionally as a part of workshop experience

### It is an adventure to the unknown

- We do not know how this group will build community.
  - It is experimental. Different people approach the unknown in different ways.
  - You can close your eyes and get through as fast at possible.
- So long as you are willing to
  - let go of your `expectations`
  - `preconceptions`
  - and get `outside your comfort zone`

### Discover what it means to be moved to speak

- This is a key part of CB: discover how you know if you are moved to speak
- We will say more in a few minutes

## Cannot tell you

### How to do it

- We give you guidelines but it is up to you how to apply them
- It is like riding a bike - you only know when you do it

### About the unknown

- We cannot say anything about the unknown because it is unknown
- We only know the destination: `Community`
- We do not know what we are going to experience along the way
  - it is the experience that makes the difference.
- The workshop is set up for you to learn experimentally.

### What this community may be

- Each group is different in how they go through these stages
- Some groups reaches, some not
  - but the experience is valuable in any case

### The mystery about how it works

- We know the process works, but we cannot explain exactly how.
- There is a mystery to the process.

### How the Spirit imparts the gift of community

- We talk about the `Spirit of community`, yet, it is a mystery
- It will make more sense at the end of the process

## Guidelines for CB

- On his workshops Dr. Peck saw that some groups reached Community, some did not.
- He studied this for several years and came up with the `Guidelines for communication`.

### 1. Say your name before you speak

- Two reasons for this
  - It helps you `own what you say`
  - It `creates space` and `help other listen and hear` what you have to say

### 2. Speak personally and specifically, using I statements

- This is one of the most important guidelines
- `Life is so hard in Budapest, one can hardly earn enough for living`
- `I am so worried how I will earn enough for my family`
- When you speak personally others get to know you personally

### 3. Speak when moved to speak, do not speak when not moved to speak

- Speak when moved to speak
  - introverted --> for whom it is hard to speak in a group
- Do not speak when not moved to speak
  - extroverted --> and easy to talk in a group
- To know when you are moved to speak, you need to look inside and discover how it works for you.
  - thoughts keep coming back
  - your heart starts beating faster
  - you know that there is something you definitely do not want to talk about
- Learning what is means to be `moved to speak` is an important lesson in CB
  - It is connected to an inner prompting.

### 4. Include others and yourself, avoid exclusivity

- Primary enemy of `Community` is exclusivity
- Two kinds:
  - exclude yourself and others from the group
    - texting
  - exclude others because they are different, annoying.
    - grouping with people you already know.

### 5. Be emotionally present

- It takes effort to stay present
- What do I need to say/do to stay present in the moment?

### 6. Take a risk

- This WS is a kind of laboratory to learn authentic communication
- We encourage you to take a risk: let people know you.
- What you put into the workshop is what you get out of it

### 7. Voice your displeasure or any dislikes to the entire group

- CB has a lot to do with truth telling
- The most important conversations can happen in breaks between 2-3 people
- Bring your displeasures, dislikes to the group from those
- Talking about the elephant in the group can be a great gift to the room

### 8. Commit to hang in there

- If you do not, you will not experience community
- If you do, you at least have a chance
- Working through frustrations, confusion, anxiety are natural in CB

### 9. Each person is responsible for their own success and the success of the group

- We are a group of leaders, not a group with a leader
- Facilitators are guides only
- Everyone is responsible for the success of the group
  - Being responsible: following the guidelines and being engaged

### 10. Participation can be verbal and non-verbal

- You can make it through the entire workshop without being moved to speak.
- Speaking is not required.
- Participation non verbally:
  - Constantly letting go of distractions
  - And returning to the voice of the person talking or to slience

### 11 Imperfection is essential

- The process is about discovery and learning - not doing it perfectly
- Mistakes happen during the process

### 12 Maintain strict confidentality

- We build trust by taking risks
- No one will take risk if they do not feel safe
- First step for safety: maintain confidentiality
- Confidentialit:
  - Not sharing anyone's story.
  - Only my own experience or general themes
- There is one limit for confidentiality:
  - If you share that you are in danger or doing violence to yourself or someone else, we are required to report it to the authorities

## Vision exercise

- For this exercise you will need a partner.
- Please find a partner
- I will read the vision two times. After that please share with your partner which word or phrase touched you, moved you and why.

> I read the vision twice

- Each person will have 2-3 minutes to share.
- Is there anyone who is willing to share what word or phrase touched them and why?

> After 3-4 shares : Thank you

### The introduction is over

- There is a break coming now
 > When we come back, we will begin with an exercise ???
